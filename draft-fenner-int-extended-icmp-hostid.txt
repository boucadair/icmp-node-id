1.  Introduction

   In addition to adding incoming interface information to a traceroute
   using the mechanisms described in [RFC5837], a network operator may
   be interested in adding information to identify nodes themselves.
   [I-D.chroboczek-int-v4-via-v6] describes a scenario in which
   individual nodes do not have unique IPv4 addresses to use to reply to
   an IPv4 traceroute, so additional information is needed.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Node Identification Object

   This section defines the Node Identification Object, an ICMP
   Extension Object with a Class-Num (Object Class Value) of TBD that
   can be appended to the following messages:

   *  ICMPv4 Time Exceeded

   *  ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable

   *  ICMPv4 Parameter Problem

   *  ICMPv6 Time Exceeded

   *  ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable

   For reasons described in [RFC4884], this extension cannot be appended
   to any of the currently defined ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 messages other than
   those listed above.

   The extension defined herein MAY be appended to any of the above
   listed messages and SHOULD be appended whenever required to identify
   an unnumbered interface and when local policy or security
   considerations do not supersede this requirement.

3.1.  C-Type Meaning in a Node Identification Object

   C-Type values in a Node Identification Object include:

   *  1: Identifies Node by Name

   If the Node Identification Object identifies the node by name, the
   Object Payload contains the configured node name.  It is presumed
   that the operator configures a unique node name for each system that
   is identified in this manner.  If the Object Payload would not
   otherwise terminate on a 32-bit boundary, it MUST be padded with
   ASCII NULL characters.

   *  2: Identifies Node by Address

   If the Node Identificaton Object identifies the node by address, the
   Object Payload contains an address sufficient to identify the node
   within the appropriate scope - global or as otherwise configured - as
   depicted in Figure 1.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              AFI              |            Reserved           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                           Address...

          Figure 1: Node Identification Object - C-Type 2 Payload

   Payload fields are defined as follows:

   *  Address Family Identifier (AFI): This 16-bit field identifies the
      type of address represented by the Address field.  Values for this
      field represent a subset of values found in the IANA registry of
      Address Family Numbers (available from
      [IANA.address-family-numbers]).  Valid values are 1 (representing
      a 32-bit IPv4 address) and 2 (representing a 128-bit IPv6
      address).

   *  Reserved: This field MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon receipt.

   *  Address: This variable-length field represents an address of
      appropriate scope (global, if none other defined) that can be used
      to identify the node.

4.  Security Considerations

   It may not be desirable to allow this information to be sent to an
   arbitrary receiver.  The addition of this information SHOULD be
   configurable, and MUST default to off.  An implementation SHOULD
   determine what objects may be appended to a given message based on
   the destination IP address of the ICMP message that will contain the
   objects.

   The intended field of use for the extensions defined in this document
   is administrative debugging and troubleshooting.  The extensions
   herein defined supply additional information in ICMP responses.
   These mechanisms are not intended to be used in non-debugging
   applications.

   This document does not specify an authentication mechanism for the
   extension that it defines.  Application developers should be aware
   that ICMP messages and their contents are easily spoofed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document will ask IANA to allocate an ICMP Extension Object
   Class referred to as TBD above.  But for now this document is just
   for discussion.
